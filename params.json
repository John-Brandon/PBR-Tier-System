{"name":"PBR Tier System","tagline":"An open source project for simulation research on the Potential Biological Removal framework of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. ","body":"# Welcome to the PBR Tier System Code Repository.\r\nThis repository includes Fortran 90/95 code for a multi-stock population dynamics model. Initial code development is occurring  under Mac OS 10.9.5, using [the free, open source, GNU Fortran 95, *gfortran* 4.2 compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran).   \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe [U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/laws/mmpa/text.htm) contains rules to limit the number of human caused mortalities to individual stocks of marine mammals. The legislation mandates that the limit, termed \"Potential Biological Removal\" (PBR), be the product of three values: (1) An estimate of abundance that \"provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or greater than the estimate\"; (2) One half of the maximum intrinsic population growth rate (in the absence of density dependence); and (3) A recovery factor between 0.1 and 1.0. \r\n\r\nPBR can be written as the simple equation: \r\nPBR = N<sub>MIN</sub> 0.50 (R<sub>MAX</sub>) (F<sub>R</sub>) \r\n\r\nThe goal of PBR, as outlined in the MMPA and quantified by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Science Service, is to a allow stocks of marine mammals to reach or exceed 50% of the carrying capacity of their environment. \r\n\r\n## Previous simulation research on PBR\r\nTaylor (1993) used simulation to explore the impact of assigning alternative percentiles of an abundance estimate to N<sub>MIN</sub>, given sampling error (e.g. assigning the mean vs lower 95th confidence interval of the abundance estimate to N<sub>MIN</sub>). The conceptual approach to this simulation testing followed the \r\nWade (1998) expanded on earlier simulation studies by Taylor (1993),  and : TODO add a couple of sentences \r\n\r\n## Management strategy evaluation (MSE)\r\nMSE involves three key steps: (i) development of a model (referred to as the operating model) which represents the system being managed; (ii) identification of candidate management strategies (in this case, features of the proposed tier system might include how historical abundance estimates are weighted, how trends are estimated, and whether abundance data older than 8 years are used), and (iii) evaluation, using simulation, of the candidate management strategies. Candidate management strategies are evaluated based on their performance relative to management objectives. In this case, the management objectives of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act are the benchmark.\r\n\r\n## Operating model synopsis\r\nThe underlying population dynamics were represented using an age-, sex-, and space-structured multiple-stock model (which also allows single-stock scenarios to be evaluated). The age-structured component of the model is an extension of single-stock assessment models employed by the NMFS scientists and the SC of the IWC (e.g., Punt 1999, Wade 2002). The single-stock model is expanded here to allow for two spatially overlapping stocks of the same species (Fig 1). This approach is similar to multi-stock models developed by the SC of the IWC for MSEs under more complicated scenarios, involving overlapping stocks, and uncertainties in stock identity with respect to catch limits (e.g. IWC 2012).\r\n\r\nThe modeling approach differs from the age-aggregated model used in previous PBR research (e.g., Taylor 1993; Wade 1998). For simple scenarios, the two approaches should result in equivalent dynamics. However, the more complex population dynamics model developed here allows a wider spectrum of scenarios to be evaluated (e.g., spatial overlap of stocks of the same species, and non-uniform age- and sex-specific human caused mortality.\r\n\r\n![Spatial Structure of the Model](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31861309/SpatialFig.png)\r\n*Figure 1.* The ranges and overlap of the two stocks are shown over the four areas. The surveyed area comprises areas 1, 2, and 3. Estimates of abundance include all animals (both stocks) in the survey area. The ranges of the two stocks overlap in area 2. \r\n\r\n### Funding and Contributors\r\nThis project is funded by the [U.S. Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council](http://www.wpcouncil.org/about-us/).
