","body":"### Welcome to the PBR Tier System Code Repository.\r\n\r\nThis repository includes Fortran 90/95 code for a multi-stock population dynamics model. The code is being developed under Mac OS 10.9.5, using [the free, open source, GNU Fortran 95, *gfortran* 4.2 compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran).   \r\n\r\nTODO: Add a couple sentences on goals\r\n\r\n# Model synopsis\r\nThe underlying population dynamics were represented using an age-, sex-, and space-structured multiple-stock model (which also allows single-stock scenarios to be evaluated). The age-structured component of the model is an extension of single-stock assessment models employed by the NMFS scientists and the SC of the IWC (e.g., Punt 1999, Wade 2002). The single-stock model is expanded here to allow for two spatially overlapping stocks of the same species (Fig 1). This approach is similar to multi-stock models developed by the SC of the IWC for MSEs under more complicated scenarios, involving overlapping stocks, and uncertainties in stock identity with respect to catch limits (e.g. IWC 2012).\r\n\r\nThe modeling approach differs from the age-aggregated model used in previous PBR research (e.g., Taylor 1993; Wade 1998). For simple scenarios, the two approaches should result in equivalent dynamics. However, the more complex population dynamics model developed here allows a wider spectrum of scenarios to be evaluated (e.g., spatial overlap of stocks of the same species, and non-uniform age- and sex-specific human caused mortality.\r\n\r\n![Spatial Structure of the Model](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31861309/SpatialFig.png)\r\n*Figure 1.* The ranges and overlap of the two stocks are shown over the four areas. The surveyed area comprises areas 1, 2, and 3. Estimates of abundance include all animals (both stocks) in the survey area. The ranges of the two stocks overlap in area 2. \r\n\r\n### Funding and Contributors\r\nThis project is funded by the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council. Drs. Paula Moreno, Andr&eacute; E.
