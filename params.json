","body":"# Welcome to the PBR Tier System Code Repository\r\nThis repository currently includes Fortran 90/95 code for an age-structured multi-stock population dynamics model. Initial code development is occurring, under Mac OS 10.9.5, using [the free, open source, GNU Fortran 95 compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran). In the near future, a related open-source repository will be linked with R code to visualize and analyze the output files from the Fortran code. \r\n\r\nLinks are provided at the top of this page to view the files in this repository, as well as to download the files therein (raw code or otherwise). Motivation and background for this project is provided below.  \r\n\r\n## Preface\r\nIt's not just the model code that's open source. Even the markdown/html file underlying the webpage you are reading is open-source. \r\n\r\n__Q1__: What exactly does that mean? \r\n\r\n__A1.1__ Legally speaking: The instant you download any file from this repository, those files are now licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/John-Brandon/PBR-Tier-System/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Any file you download comes with this open-source license attached. This was the least restrictive open-source license we could find at the time of writing. You are free to use any of this work for profit, but you can't hold any authors of code you downloaded liable for any damages. We don't know how much more open we can get than that. \r\n\r\n__A1.2__: Technically speaking: If you know how to use Git and version-control, we probably don't need to tell you that you have the power to submit edits to the file underlying this webpage through the `gh-pages` branch of the repository linked above. If you haven't used Git before, feel free to contact us directly with any questions or suggestions. You can do that by contacting the maintainer of this repository (listed at the end of this page). If you see something that is not factually correct, or important information is missing on this page -- or anything like that, in any file in this repository (Fortran, R, html or otherwise) -- let us know by contacting the maintainer ([preferably by opening an issue thread](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), which will be visible to the public). \r\n\r\n__Q__: Why is any of this important?\r\n\r\n__A__: A central goal of this project is to provide an opportunity to engage and grow the scientific community for PBR research. We've decided to use GitHub as an open-source platform to ensure transparency and reproducibility for this project. We genuinely hope this project excites ideas and novel methodological approaches for reducing scientific uncertainty, in the context of meeting the management objectives of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (or other related conservation objectives). Heck, if all you end up doing is learning how to use Git by forking this repository on your machine, then we'd be stoked on our efforts to contribute to reproducible research moving forward. Ultimately though, we have much bigger goals than that.\r\n\r\nWith all of that said, let's get into the fun...\r\n\r\n## The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act and Potential Biological Removal\r\nThe [U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/laws/mmpa/text.htm) contains rules to limit the number of human caused mortalities to individual stocks (management units) of marine mammals. In particular, the legislation mandates a \"Potential Biological Removal\" limit (PBR) to human caused mortality. Further, the MMPA prescribes that this limit should be calculated as the product of three values: (1) An estimate of abundance that \"provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or greater than the estimate\"; (2) One half of the maximum intrinsic population growth rate; and (3) A recovery factor between 0.1 and 1.0. \r\n\r\nPBR can therefore be written as the equation: \r\nPBR = N<sub>MIN</sub> 0.50 R<sub>MAX</sub> F<sub>R</sub> \r\n\r\nThe management objective of PBR, as outlined in the MMPA and quantified by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Science Service (NMFS), is to allow stocks of marine mammals to be maintained at an abundance that is 50% or more of the carrying capacity of their environment. \r\n\r\n## Previous simulation research on catch control rules \r\nSimulation testing of catch control rules was introduced to fisheries science by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (the SC). The SC's research and development started during the 1980s and is ongoing ([see Punt and Donavon, 2007, for a review](http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/603.full.pdf+html)). Generally speaking, the procedures that have been developed take into account scientific uncertainties as represented by a range of scenarios. Simulation modeling is used to evaluate the performance of alternative management strategies (e.g. catch control rules), across the set of uncertainty scenarios, given quantified management objectives. This approach for providing scientific advice to management has also become increasingly popular in recent years for evaluating management systems of more traditional commercial fisheries. The procedures originally developed by the SC are now known in fisheries science as \"Management Strategy Evaluation\" (MSE). \r\n\r\n## Management strategy evaluation \r\nMSE involves four key steps: (i) quantification of a management objective(s); (ii) development of an \"operating\" model, which represents the system being managed (the 'true' state of nature); (iii) identification of competing  management strategies; and (iv) evaluation, using simulation, of the candidate management strategies. Candidate management strategies are evaluated based on their performance relative to management objectives. In the context of this project, the management objectives of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act are the benchmark. \r\n\r\n## Previous simulation research on PBR\r\nInitial work by NMFS scientists on simulation testing of PBR was born from the procedures developed by the SC (NMFS scientists are also active members of the SC).\r\n\r\n[Taylor (1993)](https://swfsc.noaa.gov/publications/TM/SWFSC/NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-188.PDF) used simulation to explore the impact of assigning to N<sub>MIN</sub> alternative percentiles of an abundance estimate, given survey sampling error (e.g. assigning the mean vs lower 95th confidence interval of the abundance estimate to N<sub>MIN</sub>). Taylor (1993) demonstrated that a strategy of assigning the point estimate of abundance to N<sub>MIN</sub> would result in a candidate PBR that failed to meet the management objectives of the MMPA.\r\n\r\nWade (1998) expanded on the simulation studies by Taylor (1993) and considered a much larger set of uncertainty scenarios, which represented key uncertainties (bias in abundance estimates, etc.) In essence, Wade (1998) iterated over that set of scenarios and solved for the percentile of the sampling error distribution of an abundance estimate (in combination with values of F<sub>R</sub>) that resulted in meeting the management objective of the MMPA in 95% of the simulations across scenarios. The results of Wade's simulation testing form the basis for the values NMFS currently uses when calculating PBR for different stocks of marine mammals. \r\n\r\nWade and DeMaster (1999) also \r\nBelow, we describe how this study aims to expand on previous approaches. We also provide some rationale for the importance of doing so. \r\n\r\n## Operating model synopsis\r\nThe underlying population dynamics were represented using an age-, sex-, and space-structured multiple-stock model (which also allows single-stock scenarios to be evaluated). The age-structured component of the model is an extension of single-stock assessment models employed by the NMFS scientists and the SC of the IWC (e.g., Punt 1999, Wade 2002). The single-stock model is expanded here to allow for two spatially overlapping stocks of the same species (Fig 1). This approach is similar to multi-stock models developed by the SC of the IWC for MSEs under more complicated scenarios, involving overlapping stocks, and uncertainties in stock identity with respect to catch limits (e.g. IWC 2012).\r\n\r\nThe modeling approach differs from the age-aggregated model used in previous PBR research (e.g., Taylor 1993; Wade 1998). For simple scenarios, the two approaches should result in equivalent dynamics. However, the more complex population dynamics model developed here allows a wider spectrum of scenarios to be evaluated (e.g., spatial overlap of stocks of the same species, and non-uniform age- and sex-specific human caused mortality).\r\n\r\n(in this case, features of the proposed tier system might include how historical abundance estimates are weighted, how trends are estimated, and whether abundance data older than 8 years are used)\r\n\r\n![Spatial Structure of the Model](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31861309/SpatialFig.png)\r\n*Figure 1.* The ranges and overlap of the two stocks are shown over the four areas. The surveyed area comprises areas 1, 2, and 3. Estimates of abundance include all animals (both stocks) in the survey area. The ranges of the two stocks overlap in area 2. \r\n\r\n### Funding and Contributors\r\nThis project is funded by the [U.S. Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council](http://www.wpcouncil.org/about-us/).
