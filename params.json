{"name":"PBR Tier System","tagline":"An open source project for researching the Potential Biological Removal framework of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. ","body":"### Welcome to the PBR Tier System Code Repository.\r\n\r\nThis repository includes Fortran 90/95 code for a two-stock operating model. The operating model can also be a single stock by changing the `n_stocks` variable in the `input.par` file. \r\n\r\nThe code is being developed under Mac OS 10.9.5, using [the free, open source, GNU Fortran 95, *gfortran* 4.2 compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran); it is being developed using the Netbeans 8.0 integrated development environment (IDE).   \r\n\r\nThe Fortran code is currently located in the `PBR Netbeans` folder of this repository.\r\n\r\n# Status of code development\r\nThe operating model is nearly complete. I'm testing the code to allocate spatial bycatch (the population dynamics and Tier 2 (Wade, 1998) survey estimates of abundance have been tested). There is also R code being developed for reading output files and creating plots, but I haven't added that code to this repository (yet)...\r\n\r\n### Funding and Contributors\r\nThis project is funded by the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council. Drs. Paula Moreno, Andr&eacute; E. Punt and Randall R. Reeves are collaborators. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
