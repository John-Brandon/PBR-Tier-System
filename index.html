<p>This repository currently includes Fortran 90/95 code for an age-structured multi-stock population dynamics model. Initial code development is occurring, under Mac OS 10.9.5, using <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran" target="_blank">the free, open source, GNU Fortran 95 compiler</a>. In the near future, a related open-source repository will be linked with R code to visualize and analyze the output files from the Fortran code. </p>

<p>Links are provided at the top of this page to view the files in this repository, as well as to download the files therein (raw code or otherwise). Motivation and background for this project is provided below, but first a quick FAQ.</p>

<p><strong>Q2</strong>: </p>

<p>Why is open source important?</p>

<p><strong>A2</strong>: </p>

<p>One of the goals of this project is to provide an opportunity to engage and grow the scientific community for simulation research of Potential Biological Removal (aka PBR). We've decided to use GitHub as an open-source platform to ensure transparency and reproducibility. We genuinely hope this project excites ideas and methodological approaches for reducing scientific uncertainty in the context of meeting the management objectives of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, or other related conservation objectives. We also offer this as a platform to test existing ideas, which haven't been formally tested yet. PBR is also a useful concept for scientists in other countries, so an open-source repository also engenders international collaboration. Finally, you just never know who might be reading this and want to collaborate on a scientifically interesting and challenging problem. For all the author knows, you the reader might be a brilliant computer scientist working for a tech company, with a desire to improve an algorithm used to set limits on human caused mortality of marine mammals. Making this open source allows anyone with an internet connection to contribute to the code.</p>

<p>With all of that said, let's get into the fun, starting with some background...</p>

<a id="the-us-marine-mammal-protection-act-and-potential-biological-removal" class="anchor" href="#the-us-marine-mammal-protection-act-and-potential-biological-removal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act and Potential Biological Removal</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/laws/mmpa/text.htm">U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)</a> contains rules to limit the number of human caused mortalities to individual stocks (management units) of marine mammals. In particular, the legislation mandates a "Potential Biological Removal" limit (PBR) to human caused mortality. Further, the MMPA prescribes that this limit should be calculated as the product of three values: (1) An estimate of abundance that "provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or greater than the estimate"; (2) One half of the maximum intrinsic population growth rate; and (3) A recovery factor between 0.1 and 1.0. </p>

<p>PBR can therefore be written as the equation: 
PBR = N<sub>MIN</sub> 0.50 R<sub>MAX</sub> F<sub>R</sub> </p>

<p>The management objective of PBR, as outlined in the MMPA and quantified by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Science Service (NMFS), is to allow stocks of marine mammals to be maintained at an abundance that is 50% or more of the carrying capacity of their environment. </p>

<p>Simulation testing of catch control rules was introduced to fisheries science by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (the SC). The SC's research and development started during the 1980s and is ongoing (<a href="http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/603.full.pdf+html">see Punt and Donavon, 2007, for a review</a>). Generally speaking, the procedures that have been developed take into account scientific uncertainties as represented by a range of 'what if' scenarios (e.g. what if the abundance estimates are biased). These scenarios are also known as trials. Simulation modeling is used to evaluate the performance of alternative management strategies (e.g. catch control rules), across a set of trials, given quantified management objectives. </p>

<p>This approach for providing scientific advice to management has also become increasingly popular in recent years for evaluating management systems of traditional commercial fisheries. The procedures originally developed by the SC are now known in fisheries science as "Management Strategy Evaluation" (MSE). </p>

<h2>
<a id="management-strategy-evaluation" class="anchor" href="#management-strategy-evaluation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Management strategy evaluation</h2>

<p>MSE involves a few key steps, including: (i) quantification of a management objective(s); (ii) development of an "operating" model, which represents the system being managed (the 'true' state of nature); (iii) identification of a candidate management strategy(s), which also includes a data collection strategy;  (iv) developing trials that span the range of key uncertainties about the true state of nature, including trials where data is biased or imprecise; and (v) evaluation, using simulation, of the candidate management strategies. Candidate management strategies are evaluated based on their performance relative to the quantified management objectives (e.g., maintaining abundance above some level with 95% certainty). In the context of this project, the management objectives of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act are the benchmark. </p>

<a id="previous-simulation-research-on-pbr" class="anchor" href="#previous-simulation-research-on-pbr" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Previous simulation research on PBR</h2>

<p>Initial work by NMFS scientists on simulation testing of PBR was born from the procedures developed by the SC (NMFS scientists are also active members of the SC).</p>

<p><a href="https://swfsc.noaa.gov/publications/TM/SWFSC/NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-188.PDF">Taylor (1993)</a> used simulation to explore the impact of assigning to N<sub>MIN</sub> alternative percentiles of an abundance estimate, given survey sampling error (e.g. assigning the mean vs lower 95th confidence interval of the abundance estimate to N<sub>MIN</sub>). Taylor (1993) demonstrated that a strategy of assigning the point estimate of abundance to N<sub>MIN</sub> resulted in poor performance when biases existed in the data. A strategy of assigning the lower 95th confidence interval of the abundance estimate to N<sub>MIN</sub> was relatively robust to the biases that were explored. </p>

<p>Wade (1998) expanded on the simulation studies by Taylor (1993). In essence, Wade (1998) iterated over a set of trials where estimates were unbiased, but the survey estimates were allowed to be imprecise. For these trials, Wade (1998) essentially solved for the percentile of the abundance estimate that resulted in meeting the management objective of the MMPA in 95% of the simulations across scenarios. That value was the lower 20th percentile of the abundance estimate. Wade (1998) then examined a variety of trials where different biases existed in the data. For these trials, N<sub>MIN</sub> was set to the lower 20th percentile of the abundance estimate, and the process was repeated such that the value of F<sub>R</sub> was solved for such that 95% of the simulations met the management objectives. The results of Wade's simulation testing form the basis for the values NMFS currently uses when calculating PBR for stocks of marine mammals. </p>

<p>Below, we describe how the PBR Tier System study aims to expand on previous research. We also provide some rationale for doing so. </p>

<h2>
<a id="operating-model-synopsis" class="anchor" href="#operating-model-synopsis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Operating model synopsis</h2>

<p>The underlying population dynamics were represented using an age-, sex-, and space-structured multiple-stock model (which also allows single-stock scenarios to be evaluated). The age-structured component of the model is an extension of single-stock assessment models employed by the NMFS scientists and the SC of the IWC (e.g., Punt 1999, Wade 2002). The single-stock model is expanded here to allow for two spatially overlapping stocks of the same species (Fig 1). This approach is similar to multi-stock models developed by the SC of the IWC for MSEs under more complicated scenarios, involving overlapping stocks, and uncertainties in stock identity with respect to catch limits (e.g. IWC 2012).</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31861309/SpatialFig.png" alt="Spatial Structure of the Model"></p>

<p><em>Figure 1.</em> The ranges and overlap of the two stocks are shown over the four areas. The surveyed area comprises areas 1, 2, and 3. Estimates of abundance include all animals (both stocks) in the survey area. The ranges of the two stocks overlap in area 2. </p>

<p>The modeling approach differs from the age-aggregated model used in previous PBR research (e.g., Taylor 1993; Wade 1998). For simple scenarios, the two approaches should result in equivalent dynamics. However, the more complex population dynamics model developed here allows a wider spectrum of trials to be evaluated (e.g., spatial overlap of stocks of the same species, and non-uniform age- and sex-specific human caused mortality).</p>

<p>The Tier System aspect of this research involves different levels of data availability. Previous PBR research has largely  assumed that PBR would be calculated based on a single absolute estimate of abundance. </p>

<p>(although see Wade and DeMaster 1998, for an example of a PBR simulation study where multiple estimates were averaged: TODO Add this reference and wrap up the remaining last bits of text)</p>

<p>TODO?: Add image from slides showing hierarchy of tiers. 
(in this case, features of the proposed tier system might include how historical abundance estimates are weighted, how trends are estimated, and whether abundance data older than 8 years are used)</p>

<p>TODO: Add preliminary image showing population trajectories. </p>
